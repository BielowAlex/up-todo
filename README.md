# React Vite Template with React Router, Vitest, and Jest

This project is a ready-to-use template created with Vite that incorporates React Router for routing, Vitest for unit testing, and Jest for testing. It's designed to offer developers a quick start for building React applications with the best development tools integrated.

## Features

- **React 17/18**: Utilizes the latest React library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **React Router**: Integrated for handling routing in React applications, allowing for multiple page views and navigation.
- **Vitest**: A Vite-native unit testing framework that's fast and efficient, configured for testing React components.
- **Jest**: Configured as an alternative to Vitest for developers who prefer Jest for testing their applications.
